# Christmas Songs 2018
This list summarizes all songs played on Toronto's CHFI All-Christmas radio station between Dec 7 and Dec 23, 2018.
I've compared relative rankings to the same data collected in 2017 to show how song choices change year-to-year.
Hover over (or tap) a song to see the breakdown by artist. Songs dropped from the playlist this year (e.g. 
["Baby It's Cold Outside"](https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadian-radio-stations-baby-it-s-cold-outside-1.4931867))
